			<h2>&ldquo;Awesomne Dude&rdquo;</h2>

			<p>I'm a 27 year old from Lewes, Delaware, and I can do a few things.</p>

			<p>Most recently, I was a frontend developer with <a href="http://www.barackobama.com">Barack Obama's re-election campaign.</a> It truly was an honor to be a part of this team. The small role I played involved CSS, JavaScript, some zingers, and a few microsites. <a href="mailto:conorsg@gmail.com">I'd be happy to talk more about it if you're interested.</a></p>

			<p>I also have some academic creds. I did a master's in 2011 in political thought and intellectual history at Cambridge. I wrote my dissertation on G.E. Moore and Wittgenstein. I went into the archives and looked at some exchanges they had concerning logic. I wrote about how these help us understand differences in Wittgenstein's thought on logic and language between his early and late periods. <a href="/files/diss-excerpt.pdf">You can read an excerpt here.</a></p>

			<p>Finally, I recently published an article on American federalism and the Wisconsin recall election in <em>Renewal</em>, a British journal for social democracy. <a href="http://renewal.org.uk/issues/vol-20-no-2-3-2012/">That can be found here.</a></p>

			<p>Feel free to take a look at the rest of my stuff:</p>
